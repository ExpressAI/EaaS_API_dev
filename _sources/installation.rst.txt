Installation
============



To install EaaS, simply run::

   pip install eaas

To use the API, run the following as a simple example::

   from eaas import Client
   client = Client()

   # To use this API for scoring, you need to format your input as list of dictionary. Each dictionary consists of `src` (string, optional), `refs` (list of string, optional) and `hypo` (string, required). `src` and `refs` are optional based on the metrics you want to use. Please do not conduct any preprocessing on `src`, `refs` or `hypo`, we expect normal-cased detokenized texts. All preprocessing steps are taken by the metrics. Below is a simple example.

   inputs = [{"src": "This is the source.",
              "refs": ["This is the reference one.", "This is the reference two."],
              "hypo": "This is the generated hypothesis."}]
   metrics = ["bleu", "chrf"] # Can be None for simplicity if you consider using all metrics

   score_dic = client.score(inputs, metrics) # inputs is a list of Dict, metrics is metric list

The output is like::

   {
     'bleu': [32.46679154750991],  # Sample-level scores. A list of scores one for each sample.
     'corpus_bleu': 32.46679154750991, # Corpus-level score.
     'chrf': [38.56890099861521],
     'corpus_chrf': 38.56890099861521
   }
